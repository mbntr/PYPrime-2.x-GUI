# PYPrime-2.x-GUI

This is a new version of PYPrime 2.0, it's still deep in Beta, you may find some performance discrepancies between this one and the standard CLI builds.
For the time being to get the most accurate possible results enable the "Performance Mode", which thanks to some arcane magic (disabling the progress bar)
reduces the differences to almost zero.
